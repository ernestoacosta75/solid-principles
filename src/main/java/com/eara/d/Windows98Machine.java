 *
 * Dependency Inversion:
 * The principle states that we must use abstraction (abstract classes and interfaces)
 * instead of concrete implementations. High-level modules should not depend on the low-level module
 * but both should depend on the abstraction. Because the abstraction does not depend on detail but
 * the detail depends on abstraction. It decouples the software.
 *
 * Here, we're using the dependency injection pattern to facilitate adding the
 * Keyboard and Monitor dependencies into the Windows98Machine class.
